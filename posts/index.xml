      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in putting up my own website for some time, and
I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to make it happen. The coronavirus pandemic (I&amp;rsquo;ve
seen it referred to in one news article as &amp;ldquo;the ongoing global
situation&amp;rdquo;) has offered me more time than expected to work on personal
projects, so I have been assembling this site for the last several
days. In this post, I briefly discuss my motivations and goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My journey to having a fully functional site where I can publish
content was somewhat convoluted, but highly educational. In this post,
I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing what I learned, discussing the process of creating a
site using Emacs and Org mode, and comparing the two leading static
site generators: Jekyll and Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
