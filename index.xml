      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been interested in putting up my own website for some time, and
I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to make it happen. The coronavirus pandemic (I&amp;rsquo;ve
seen it referred to in one news article as &amp;ldquo;the ongoing global
situation&amp;rdquo;) has offered me more time than expected to work on personal
projects, so I have been assembling this site for the last several
days. In this post, I briefly discuss my motivations and goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My journey to having a fully functional site where I can publish
content was somewhat convoluted, but highly educational. In this post,
I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing what I learned, discussing the process of creating a
site using Emacs and Org mode, and comparing the two leading static
site generators: Jekyll and Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is a list of my personal projects. Many are engineering efforts and some were undertaken for the sake of learning. I feel that all those listed are notable enough to include for now, but some will be removed in the future, and more will certainly be added.
Several of these projects are not yet completed to my satisfaction, and I am continuing work on the ones that I consider most valuable.</description>

      <description>If you are recruiting developers or engineers, I am interested. I also want to hear any feedback you have about my projects or the site itself.
If you really want to find my email address, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can. Otherwise, use this form to contact me just as easily.

      <description>Table of Contents  Creating site content Generating the site Serving the site Languages used    All of the content on this site is either my work or is in the public domain. I designed and implemented the user interface and style myself.
To make this project easier, and serve the website to you, I used a stack of excellent tools.
Creating site content GNU Emacs In my opinion, the greatest text editor / integrated development environment ever created.</description>
