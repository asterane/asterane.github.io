<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Matthew Rothlisberger. I am an aspiring electrical
engineer and software developer.</p>
<p>I am passionate about engineering as a mechanism to improve our world;
I find it fulfilling to implement effective solutions for difficult
and meaningful problems. Whenever possible, I try to discover, learn,
and use the best tools available. My <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> showcase some of my
work.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h2>
<p>This site serves as a portfolio of my education, my work experience,
and of the engineering projects I have taken on over the
years. Sufficiently notable projects will be added and updated as I
make progress.</p>
<p>My <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> is also hosted here. It is a place for me to write about
problems and solutions that interest me, primarily in the fields of
electrical engineering and software engineering. New posts will arrive
when I write them.</p>
<p>For more information on the technologies used to build this site,
consult the <a href="/colophon/">Colophon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>To date, most recent to least recent:</p>
<h3 id="utah-state-university">Utah State University</h3>
<p><em>2021 - 2025</em></p>
<p><strong>In Progress</strong></p>
<p><strong>B.S. Electrical Engineering</strong></p>
<p>I have begun my study of electrical engineering at Utah State
University. I deferred my admission a year due to coronavirus
measures, and I expect to complete my Bachelor of Science degree in
Spring 2025. My courses so far have primarily covered programming and
digital circuit design.</p>
<h3 id="thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</h3>
<p><em>2016 - 2020</em></p>
<p><strong>Graduated</strong></p>
<p><strong>Electrical Engineering Focus</strong></p>
<p>I attended TJHSST for ninth through twelfth grades after being
admitted through an extensive application process. The highlights of
my experience were the two years of hands on electrical engineering
classes I took. We began with analog circuit design and built up to
processor design, signal processing, and more.</p>
<h2 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h2>
<p>Again, most to least recent:</p>
<h3 id="event-technician">Event Technician</h3>
<p><em>2021 -</em></p>
<p><strong>USU Event Services</strong></p>
<p>I am responsible for setting up and taking down audiovisual equipment
for events on a university campus, and for managing these events to
ensure that they run smoothly. Locations include a variety of venues,
indoor and outdoor. This is somewhat similar to my past audiovisual
work.</p>
<h3 id="software-developer">Software Developer</h3>
<p><em>2020 -</em></p>
<p><strong>Freelance</strong></p>
<p>I freelanced while my university admission was deferred, and still do
to an extent. I am working on various software projects using
languages and tools I am familiar with. Whenever I have time, I work
on open source and make an effort to learn valuable new engineering
skills.</p>
<h3 id="senior-audiovisual-technician">Senior Audiovisual Technician</h3>
<p><em>2018 - 2020</em></p>
<p><strong>Fairfax County Public Schools</strong></p>
<p>I was responsible for overseeing dozens of community events in an
auditorium that seats several hundred people. I developed proficiency
hanging and programming lighting fixtures; interfacing audio equipment
and equalizing signals; and working with customers of many cultures to
see their events through. I often worked under time pressure and under
unforeseen circumstances to ensure that events ran well.</p>
