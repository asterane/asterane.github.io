<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Matthew Rothlisberger. I am a software engineer and
electrical engineer.</p>
<p>I am passionate about engineering as a mechanism to improve our world;
I find it fulfilling to implement effective solutions for difficult
and meaningful problems. I do my best to discover, learn, and use the
best tools available. My <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> showcase some of my work.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h2>
<p>This site serves as a portfolio of my education, my work experience,
and of the engineering projects I have taken on over the
years. Sufficiently notable projects will be added and updated as I
make progress.</p>
<p>My <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> is also hosted here. It is a place for me to write about
problems and solutions that interest me, primarily in the fields of
electrical engineering and software engineering. New posts will arrive
when I write them.</p>
<p>For more information on the technologies used to build this site,
consult the <a href="/colophon/">Colophon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<h3 id="thomas-jefferson-high-school-for-science-and-technology">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</h3>
<p><em>2016 - 2020</em></p>
<p><strong>Graduated</strong></p>
<p><strong>Electrical Engineering Focus</strong></p>
<p>I attended TJHSST for ninth through twelfth grades after being
admitted through an extensive application process. The highlights of
my experience were the two years of hands on electrical engineering
classes I took. We began with analog circuit design and built up to
processor design, signal processing, and more.</p>
<h2 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h2>
<h3 id="audiovisual-event-technician">Audiovisual Event Technician</h3>
<p><em>2021 -</em></p>
<p><strong>USU Event Services</strong></p>
<p>I supply audio, video, and lighting services for events in spaces
across a large college campus. I work independently and as part of a
team in equal measure. I set up and strike equipment, manage events to
ensure that they run smoothly, and operate indoors and outdoors. I am
skilled with all the equipment we use, including mixers, light boards,
video controllers, audio processors, and integration consoles.</p>
<h3 id="software-developer">Software Developer</h3>
<p><em>2020 -</em></p>
<p><strong>Freelance</strong></p>
<p>I freelanced while my university admission was deferred, and still do
to an extent. I am working on various software projects using
languages and tools I am familiar with. Whenever I have time, I work
on open source and make an effort to learn valuable new engineering
skills.</p>
<h3 id="senior-audiovisual-technician">Senior Audiovisual Technician</h3>
<p><em>2018 - 2020</em></p>
<p><strong>Fairfax County Public Schools</strong></p>
<p>I was responsible for overseeing dozens of community events in an
auditorium that seats several hundred people. I developed proficiency
hanging and programming lighting fixtures; interfacing audio equipment
and equalizing signals; and working with customers of many cultures to
see their events through. I often worked under time pressure and under
unforeseen circumstances to ensure that events ran well.</p>
